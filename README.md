This dataset was procured from OpenDataPhilly.org. The heat vulnerbility scores are on a scale between -8 being the least vulnerable to 8 being the most vulnerable. The scores are aggregated by census tract ann neighborhood. I chose neighborhood to add reality to the map as not everyone is familiar with census tracts. The most vulnerable populations are situated in lower income areas which is no surprise and very unfortunate. These spatial analyses are important becuase they speak to the problem directly and are on a simple scale with easily obtained data.
